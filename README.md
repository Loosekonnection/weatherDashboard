## Pseudo Code
<br>

*   The weather dashboard is to provide the current days weather as well as a 5 day forecast.
*   To acheieve this it will require an API weather provider.
*   From the API data I need to capture:

    *   Weather Image
    *   Temperature  
    *   Humidity
    *   Wind Speed
    *   UV Index (colour coded)

*   The webpage will need a search field for the end user to type a city name in. 
*   When the the end user searches for a city, the city name will need to be shown in a search history area.
*   The city name in the search area should be clickable to return the weather back to the web page.
*   The current days weather should be displayed to the right of the search area within its own area.
*   The 5-day summary forecast should be presented below the current day.
*   Each of the days ahead needs to be clearly seperated out to make each day easily identifiable. 
*   Each of the 5-day summary should contain:

    *   Weather Image
    *   Temperature
    *   Humidity

*   The end user must be able to clear the results history, a 'Clear Results' button will need to be generated.
*   On a relaod of the page the search history must be persistent, and display the last searched city's weather data.
